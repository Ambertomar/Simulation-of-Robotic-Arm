# Simulation-of-Robotic-Arm
## Open Project 2023


## Abstract
This project presents a MATLAB simulation of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robotic arm. The objective is to design and analyze the kinematics and dynamics of the robotic arm using MATLAB's robotics toolbox. The simulation models a robotic arm with six interconnected joints capable of moving independently.
It demonstrates the successful utilization of MATLAB for simulating a 6-DOF robotic arm. The implemented algorithms for kinematics, dynamics, and path planning enable accurate motion control and trajectory generation. The simulation serves as a valuable tool for studying and optimizing the performance of robotic arms in diverse real-world scenarios.

## Motivation
Motivation behind a MATLAB simulation project involving a 6-DOF robotic arm includes performance evaluation, motion planning and control development, algorithm validation, training and education, as well as cost and time efficiency in the design and optimization process. The simulation serves as a valuable tool for studying and optimizing the performance of robotic arms in diverse real-world scenarios.

## Mechanical Aspect
1. we have created a 3D model of a robtic arm with 6 DOF along with its gripper in the SOLIDWORKS Cad software from scratch.
2. we took special type of robotic arm i.e 6 DOF serial robot.A serial robot with six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) refers to a type of robotic arm that consists of a series of connected links or segments, with each joint providing one degree of freedom for motion. The term "serial" implies that the joints are arranged in a sequential or linear configuration, where the output of one joint serves as the input for the next joint.
3. For picking up the object, we designed the gripper which is easy to operate. it can be easily controlled with the help of only 1 servo motor.

## Software Aspect
For the software part we used, SOLIDWORKS , MATLAB , SIMULINK and SIMSCAPE MULTIBODY.
